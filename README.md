Project Overview

The To-Do List App allows users to add, view, and manage tasks. It can be a simple static interface or an interactive dynamic app with additional functionality using JavaScript. However, with just HTML and CSS, we focus on structuring the app and styling it for a visually appealing layout.

Features (HTML & CSS)
  
   Input field for users to type in tasks.
    A button to submit new tasks.
    View Tasks

A list or grid to display added tasks.
Organized Layout

A structured layout that separates sections (e.g., header, task input, task list).
Style Enhancements

Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
Styling for individual tasks (e.g., cards, hover effects).
Clear visual cues for completed or active tasks.

Project Structure
HTML:

Semantic structure for the app.
Use elements like <header>, <main>, <ul>, <li>, <form>, and <button>.

CSS:

Use CSS to style the app and enhance its usability and aesthetics.
Implement features like:
Font selection and styling.
Spacing, padding, and alignment.
Background colors, gradients, and shadows.


Next Steps

While HTML and CSS set up the structure and visuals, you can further enhance the functionality using JavaScript (e.g., task completion, deletion, or saving tasks).
Experiment with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind for a modern look.
